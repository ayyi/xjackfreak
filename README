XJackFreak is audio analysis/EQ tool for GNU/Linux/X11/Jack Audio Connection Kit.

It can display the FFT of any input, modify it and output the result.

See docs/xjackfreak.png for a nice picture  and docs/manual for more info.


Install is as per usual:

./configure
make
make install


The only dependencies are the C library, X11 & Jack Audio Connection Kit.
(libX11-devel, libXext-devel, jack-audio-connection-kit-devel)

It should compile with either Jack V1 or V2.

Any probs, then email me.

Have fun!
